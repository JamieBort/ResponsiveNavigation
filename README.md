# Activity: Responsive Navigation - Pair Programming
## Implement Responsive Navigation with 2 Breakpoints  
Download the assets folder and follow the steps below.
[Source Files]().

The downloaded zip contains three subfolders, `resources`, `solution`, and `starter_files`.

* `resources` - contains screenshots of the final website at three sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop. Use these images as to guide the styling of the HTML page.

* `solution` - contains the completed version of the navigation. **Don't look at this till your group has made a concerted effort to match the mockups.** If you get stuck, you can take a peek at the solution to jumpstart your progress. The point of a solution folder is to ensure that you never get completely stuck. That being said, it's in your best interest to try to finish the activity without help, if possible.

* `starter_files` - contains the `index.html` and `style.css` pages. **Don't edit the HTML page**. You can match the mockups with nothing more than CSS, so you have no reason to edit the HTML. Because this assignment is about responsive layout, some of the more basic visual styles are already in place in the CSS document.

**Your job is to finish the CSS to match the HTML page to the 3 responsive layouts.**

Step 1: Review the provided layouts and compare them with the current state of the HTML page
* Open `mobile.png`, `tablet.png`, and `desktop.png` with Preview.
* Open the `starter_files` folder in your text editor.
* Open `index.html` in Chrome.
* Comparing the website with the layout, taking note of which styles have been applied and which have not.
* Use Chrome DevTools to examine the code.

Step 2: Complete the CSS to match the appropriate layout at each breakpoint size
* Add styles and media queries to the CSS to match the layout.
* Use Chrome DevTools to check your refactored code against the output.
